Analyzing Amazon reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program
## Overview
  The purpose of this analysis is to look at a dataset of reviews on musical instruments on Amazon. Then analyze how the Vine program reviews compare to reviews not a part of the vine program.
## Results
Analysis of the dataset results is below:

- How many Vine reviews and non-Vine reviews were there?
  - There is a total number of 60 paid Vine Reviews
  - There is a total number of 14,477 non-Vine reviews

## Summary
  In summary, I do not believe there is any positivity bias for the reviews in the Vine program. There was a total number of 60 Vine program reviews and 34 of those reviews were 5 stars, which means about 56 percent of the reviews in the Vine program are 5 stars. An additional analysis that I would do with this dataset is to compare how many of those Vine program reviews were 2-star reviews or below.
